	The rule states that you should spend up to 50% of your after-tax income on needs and obligations
        that you must-have or must-do. The remaining half should be split up between 20% savings and debt 
        repayment and 30% to everything else that you might want.

 -   70,20,10
	Both 70-20-10 and 50-30-20 are elementary percentage breakdowns for spending, saving, and sharing money.
        Using the 70-20-10 rule, every month a person would spend only 70% of the money they earn, save 20%, and 
        then they would donate 10%.
